# Set 03

Only selected problems will have a solution.

### Problem 1

Let the Shape type be:
```fsharp
type Shape =
/// A circle of a radius.
| Circle of float
/// A square with a side length.
| Square of float
/// A triangle with side lengths.
| Triangle of float * float * float
```

Write a function `area`, which computes the area of a given shape. You can
assume that the Shape type is well-formed, i.e., we will construct a Shape with
a valid values. We will *not* have a Circle with negative radius for instance.

```fsharp
val area : Shape -> float
```

##### Solution

```fsharp
let area = function
  | Circle r -> if r > 0.0 then Math.PI * r * r else nan
  | Square l -> if l > 0.0 then l * l else nan
  | Triangle (a, b, c) ->
    if a > 0.0 && b > 0.0 && c > 0.0 && a + b > c && b + c > a && c + a > b then
      let s = (a + b + c) / 2.0
      sqrt <| s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)
    else nan
```

### Problem 2

We learned in the class how we can declare pairs (tuples) in F#. For example, we
can create a pair of two integers as follows:
```fsharp
(1, 2)
```
In this problem, however, we will define a pair using a function. Specifically,
we define a constructor function for a pair of integers as follows:
```fsharp
let pair (x: int) (y: int) m : int = m x y
```
With the pair function we can create a pair as follows:
```fsharp
let p = pair 1 2
```
Define a function `fst` that returns the first element of the pair. For example,
`pair 1 2 |> fst` should return 1.

### Problem 3

Consider a data type `Time` representing a time of day:
```fsharp
type AMPM =
  | AM
  | PM

type Time = {
  Hours: int
  Minutes: int
  AMPM: AMPM
}
```
Note that Hours field should have integer values from 0 to 11, whereas Minutes
should have values from 0 to 59. Moreover, we assume that every input values
with type `Time` always have valid values.

Define a function `isEarly` that takes in two Time values `t1` and `t2` and
returns true if `t1` is earlier than `t2`. For example, when `t1` is `{ Hours =
1; Minutes = 30; AM }` and `t2` is `{ Hours = 1; Minutes = 0; PM }`, then the
function returns `true`. Note that if `t1` and `t2` are same, `isEarly` should
return `false`.

```fsharp
val isEarly : Time -> Time -> bool
```

##### Solution

```fsharp
let isEarly t1 t2 =
  match t1.AMPM, t2.AMPM with
  | AM, PM -> true
  | PM, AM -> false
  | _ ->
    if t1.Hours < t2.Hours then true
    elif t1.Hours > t2.Hours then false
    elif t1.Minutes < t2.Minutes then true
    else false
```

### Problem 4

Define a function `addMinutes` that takes in a Time value `t` and an integer
value `m`, and returns a new Time value that is `m` minutes after `t`. If `m` is
negative, then the function returns a Time value that is `- m` minutes before
`t`.

```fsharp
val addMinutes : Time -> int -> Time
```

### Problem 5

Let us consider a straight line (y = ax + b) in the plane. We represent a
straight line with:
```fsharp
type StraightLine = a: int * b: int
```
Define a function `mirrorX` that takes in a StraightLine and returns a new
StraightLine mirrored around the x-axis. And, define a function `mirrorY` that
takes in a StraightLine and returns a new StraightLine mirrored around the
y-axis.

```fsharp
val mirrorX : StraightLine -> StraightLine
val mirrorY : StraightLine -> StraightLine
```

##### Solution

```fsharp
let mirrorX = function
  | StraightLine (a, b) -> StraightLine (-a, -b)

let mirrorY = function
  | StraightLine (a, b) -> StraightLine (-a, b)
```
